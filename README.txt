Take control of your home's comfort with the Bosch EasyControl CT200 app for Homey. This app brings seamless integration of your Bosch EasyControl CT200 thermostat into your smart home ecosystem, allowing you to monitor and adjust your home's temperature remotely and create intelligent heating automations.

Features include:

— Monitor current temperature
— Set target temperature
— Monitor system pressure
— Monitor Wi-Fi connection strength

To get connection details:

- Serial Number: this is printed on the back of the device (nine digits).
- Access Key: this is printed on the back of the device.
- Password: in the EasyControl app go to Menu -> Settings -> Personal -> Change password.

By default, the app polls the status every 30 seconds. This can be changed in the settings of the device. Bosch may block you from accessing data if you set this value too low.

This app is based on the reverse engineering work of Robert Klep (https://github.com/robertklep/bosch-xmpp).
